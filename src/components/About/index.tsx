						I&apos;m <strong>Joshua Alexander</strong>, a Full Stack Developer
						from BC, Canada. I graduated from Acadia University in 2020 with a
						BSc. in <strong>Computer Science</strong> (3.81 GPA). I love working
						with Javascript frameworks, and my preferred frameworks are Next.js
						and sometimes Remix. I have been working with React my entire
						career, and I have a passion for building user-friendly interfaces
						and applications. I enjoy using Express or Nest.js on the backend,
						but in general I find the Next.js backend to be sufficient for most
						of my needs. I love Prisma and PostgreSQL. My ideal stack is{" "}
						<strong>Next.js, Prisma, TailwindCSS and PostgreSQL,</strong> that
						is where I feel at home.
						<br />
						<br />
						As for other technologies, I have done data scraping and analytics
						with Python as well, and that is something I enjoy doing in my spare
						time. I love a little python script. üêç I&apos;ve dabbled in Go with
						HTMX as well.
						<br />
						<br />
						As you may tell from my projects, I have a passion for Chess,
						roleplaying games, and fantasy video games. I love building tools
						that help people enjoy these hobbies, and I have a few projects in
						the works that I hope to release soon.
						<br />
						<br />I am currently living in Tbilisi, Georgia for the past several
						years working remotely as Full Stack Developer.
